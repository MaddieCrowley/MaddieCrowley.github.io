    Some of my other hobbies include lasers and optics. Among this is the desire for exotic colored lasers, the easiest
    of which to obtain is a "sky-blue" laser. These diodes' wavelength is outside the color gamut that can be
    represented on a computer monitor, so the only way to actually see the correct color is to see one in real life.
    And, since I'm me, why buy one when I can design the entire thing from scratch. This page focuses on the portion of
    the project I actually finished, the power supply. This is a constant-current switched-mode power supply in a small
    form factor that drives the particular laser diode I chose on just the edge of turning on, since most laser diodes
    of this wave length are at the 50mW level and I want to use this as a general laser pointer, so low power is the
    name of the game. Anyways, all this culminated in the design and creation of a small form factor power supply
    (2x1.15 in) which would be capable of driving the laser diode, and be easily adjustable should more power be
    required.
