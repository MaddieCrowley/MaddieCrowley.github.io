            MFPL (Maddie's Favorite Programming Language) is my custom programming language! It is
            presently very much so a work in progress but has been a great way to learn about the different
            parts of compilation. Presently, I am working on the lexer, the AST, and the parser
            (so most of the language), which will then be thrown into LLVM for compilation. <br><br>
            The language takes a lot of inspiration from FORTRAN and C/Verilog as those happen to be the
            languages I've been working in recently. It relies on the programmer to impliment for and
            while loops from their basic components, if and goto statements. Eventually, all data
            will be stored as arrays of bits, once I figure out how to do that, enabling the user to
            define a datatype with relative easy (presently all numbers are C-style integers).
            <div class="list">The language also implements only basic operators, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Addition</li>
                    <li>Subtraction</li>
                    <li>Multiplication</li>
                    <li>Division</li>
                    <li>Increment</li>
                    <li>Decrement</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            Overall, the language enables broad compilation without difficulty, which was one of the original
            goals, since I plan to use this for programming on a processor of my own design eventually. But
            for now, the programming language is my current project. Also, once the project gets to a semi-
            functional state, I will make the git repo public, but for now it is remaining private. Check
            back here for updates!
